# C Pointers
A repository for beginners to start with C pointers. The repository contains basic minimal explanations and some example codes.The example codes have an expected output section.<br>
*NOTE :* The memory addresses in example codes may change for every execution.<br>
This repository starts with concepts of memory management. This helps in better understanding about how pointers work as they are closely related with memory. This ability of C pointers also makes it suitable choice for writing low level layers, device drivers, embedded applications, etc programs. It further delves into using pointers for dynamic memory management. Then there is a try to understand the interdependence and functionalities of pointers and functions. Finally common use cases of pointers with arrays and strings is illustrated.
