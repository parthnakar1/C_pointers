# C Pointers
A repository for beginners to start with C pointers. The repository contains basic minimal explanations and some example codes.The example codes have an expected output section.<br>
*NOTE :* The memory addresses in example codes may change for every execution.
This repository starts with concepts of memory management. This helps in better understanding about how pointers work as they are closely related with memory. This ability of C pointers also makes it suitable choice for writing low level layers, device drivers, embedded applications, etc programs. It further delves into using pointers for dynamic memory management. Then there is a try to understand the interdependence and functionalities of pointers and functions. Finally common use cases of pointers with arrays and strings is illustrated.
